#### Data Model and 3 collections
##### Data Model
1. Users Collection (Root collection containing user documents)
   - Document ID: User's UID from Firebase Auth
   - Fields: username, photoURL
2. Posts Subcollection (Nested under each user document)
   - Document ID: Auto-generated
   - Fields:
     imageUrl: URL of uploaded image
     description: Post text
     date: User-selected date
     location: Object containing coordinates
     breed: Detected dog breed
     confidence: Breed detection confidence
     createdAt: Timestamp of post creation
3. Breeds Subcollection (Nested under each user document)
    - Document ID: Breed name
    - Fields:
      breedName: Name of dog breed
      count: Number of posts with this breed
4. Notification Subcollection (Nested under each user document)
   We will implement it in the following iteration

##### CRUD operations
1. Users Collection:
    - Create: writeUserToDB() - Creates new user document with custom ID
    - Read: getDocument() - Fetches user data (used in ProfileScreen)
    - Update: updateDB() - Updates user data (for notification settings and changing image)

2. Posts subcollection:
   - Create: createPost() - Creates new post in user's posts subcollection
   - Read:
     - fetchPosts() in HomeScreen - Fetches all posts for a user
     - Query in MyBreedScreen - Fetches posts filtered by breed
     - getCollectionCount() in Leaderboard - Fetches all posts and gets count
   - Update: updatePost() - Updates existing post
   - Delete: deletePost() - Deletes specific post

3. Breeds subcollection:
   - Create: updateBreedCount() - Creates new breed document if doesn't exist
   - Read:
      - Query in ProfileScreen - Fetches all breeds for top breeds display
      - Query in MyBreedScreen - Fetches breed collection
      - getCollectionCount() in Leaderboard - Fetches all breeds and gets count
   - Update: updateBreedCount() - Updates breed count, increments when new post is made and decrements when post is deleted
